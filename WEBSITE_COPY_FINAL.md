We Build Enterprise Systems That Actually Ship.

**Subheadline:**
Your strategic partner for complex enterprise challenges. We architect AI systems, consolidate fragmented platforms, and modernize legacy infrastructure for mid-market and enterprise companies.

**Trust Statement:**
Most of our clients come from referrals. Your trust is more valuable than any contract—we only take on projects where we're genuinely the right fit.

**CTA Button:**

## VALUE PROPOSITION SECTION

**Headline:**
Built for Quality, Not Speed

**Body:**
According to the **Standish Group**, only **16% of software projects** are delivered on time and on budget. **McKinsey** found that large IT projects run **45% over budget** and deliver **56% less value** than predicted—and **17% go so badly** they threaten the company's existence.

We're in the **16% that actually deliver**.

We optimize for "will this work in production?"—not "how fast can we ship?" Rigorous architecture. Thorough testing. Systems designed to scale and evolve with your business.

Our process prioritizes long-term reliability over short-term demos.

**Our typical engagements:** 3-12 months, delivering production-ready systems with measurable business impact.

**Design Note:** Add trust badge logos here (McKinsey, Standish Group, Harvard Business Review, BCG) - greyscale, small, tasteful

## HOW WE WORK SECTION

**Headline:**
Partnership, Not Just Delivery

**Intro:**
**BCG's 2024 study** reveals that two-thirds of large-scale tech programs fail to meet their timeline, budget, or scope. The reason? Agencies throw code over the wall.

We don't believe in that. Our engagement model is designed to transfer knowledge, build internal capability, and ensure you own what we build.

**The Process:**

**1. Discovery & Architecture (Weeks 1-3)**
We map your current systems, identify constraints, and design the solution architecture. You'll understand exactly what we're building, why we're building it that way, and what it will take to succeed.

**2. Proof of Value (Week 4-6)**
We build a working slice of the critical path first—the riskiest integration, the core workflow, the key performance requirement. You see progress in working software, not slide decks.

**3. Iterative Delivery (Sprints)**
We ship production-ready features in 2-week cycles. High-risk, high-value capabilities first. You can deploy incrementally or wait for the full system—your choice.

**4. Transition & Ownership**
We document everything, train your team, and ensure you can maintain and extend the system. You own your technology and can run it independently. Of course, we're available for ongoing support and enhancements if you need us—but you're never locked in.

## WHY CLYVANTA SECTION

**Headline:**
Why Companies Choose Us

---

### We Say No More Than Yes

We focus on complex enterprise challenges that require deep expertise—AI integration, platform consolidation, legacy modernization. This specialization means when we take on a project, we bring proven experience solving similar problems. We're not a generalist shop trying to be everything to everyone.

---

### We Measure What Matters

We don't talk about "innovative solutions" or "cutting-edge technology." We talk about manual processing time cut by 60%. Support overhead reduced by 80%. Five platforms consolidated into one. If we can't measure it, we don't build it.

---

### You Own Everything

We transfer knowledge as we build. We document architectural decisions. We train your team. The goal isn't to create dependency—it's to build your internal capability while solving the immediate challenge.

---

### Security & Compliance Built In

We follow enterprise-grade security practices from day one. Secure coding standards, regular security audits, compliance with industry regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2). Your data and your customers' data are protected at every layer.

---

### Built on Trust & Referrals

**Harvard Business Review** found that **84% of all B2B sales begin with a referral**. That's why most of our clients come from referrals—CTOs and VPs who trust our work enough to recommend us to their peers. We don't advertise. We earn every engagement through proven results and long-term relationships.

---

### Strategic Investment, Not Cost

Our engagements typically run 3-12 months, with investment levels that reflect the complexity and business impact of the challenge we're solving. This isn't an expense—it's an investment in competitive advantage. Our clients typically see ROI within 12-18 months through operational efficiency, reduced support costs, or new revenue capabilities.

---

## CASE STUDY SECTION

**Headline:**
Platform Consolidation for Multi-Site Operations

**The Challenge:**
A property management company was operating five separate software systems—one for resident payments, one for maintenance requests, one for amenity booking, one for package tracking, and one for communications. Each system had its own login, its own support burden, and constant data synchronization issues.

**Our Solution:**
We built a unified platform that integrated all functionality under one roof. The new system connected to their existing enterprise systems (Salesforce, SAP) via API, pulling real-time data while presenting a single, seamless interface for residents and staff.

**The Impact:**
- **80% reduction** in support tickets
- **Single unified platform** replacing five vendor relationships
- **Real-time synchronization** eliminating data entry errors
- **$200K annual savings** in administrative overhead

**Design Note:** Display metrics in 2x2 grid on desktop, stacked on mobile

## FINAL CALL-TO-ACTION SECTION

**Headline:**
Let's Talk About Your Challenge

**Body:**
If you're facing a complex technology challenge—integrating AI without breaking existing systems, consolidating fragmented platforms, or modernizing legacy infrastructure—we should talk.

Not a sales call. A strategy conversation.

We'll assess your situation, identify the core technical challenge, and outline what it would take to solve it. **Your trust is more valuable than any contract.** If we're not the right fit, we'll tell you honestly.

Most of our clients come from referrals—they were introduced to us by CTOs and engineering leaders who trusted our work. That's the standard we hold ourselves to.
